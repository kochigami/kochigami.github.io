      About my research<br>
      <font size="+0">	  
	I am interested in an interactive robot which can interact with people.<br>
	Such kind of a robot is expected to be the existence of someone who has their own personality, rather than just a machine.<br>
	Especially, I focus on children and have been considering two questions below:<br>
	- What is important for a robot in order to become “someone” for children?<br>
	- How do children treat a robot?<br>
	I have been searching for these questions by designing software and hardware for a robot and evaluating them in field trials.<br> 
	My research goal is creating a robot which meditates interaction between children and other people by enriching interaction between children and a robot.<br>
